 ## Seat booking app (Alpha version) ##

## Features ##

The app lets you choose a specific date and play. For the option you selected, it displays the seats that were already booked (displayed in grey color) and the avaible ones in red color. Each time you click on a seat, it will change its color to grey, and will be added to the shopping cart. There, you can select the category (adult, elev, pensionar) and the price for that category will be updated. Everytime you choose another seat, the total price is being updated. Moreover, if you change your mind about a specific seat, by clicking again on it, it is deleted from the shopping cart, and is "free" again. By clicking on the submit button, your order is being processed and you'll receive an email with the order details.
