The program is given as input "encrypt" or "decrypt", depending on the option,
the name of the file that has to be encrypted, the name of the new file
generated (with the encrypted content) and the name of the file that contains
the seed and the started value. Starting value and the seed must have 8 or 9 digits.

For every word in the file, a new process is created, which encrypts / decrypts
each word loaded from the shared memory
